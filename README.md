- **Rust-Powered**: Built with Rust for enhanced safety, concurrency, and performance.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on various operating systems supported by Rust.
- **Customizable**: Configurable settings to fine-tune search parameters according to user needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (ensure it is installed and updated)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ashborn3/scrutator.git
    cd scrutator
    ```

2. Build the project in release mode:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Search

Run Scrutator with a search query:

```sh
./target/release/scrutator <search_query>
```

Replace `<search_query>` with the term you are searching for. Scrutator will output the paths of matching files.

### Advanced Search Options

Scrutator supports various command-line options to customize the search behavior. For detailed usage instructions, run:

```sh
./target/release/scrutator --help
```

## Configuration

Scrutator can be configured using a configuration file to set default search parameters, caching preferences, and more. Place the configuration file in the root directory of the project. A sample configuration file (`config.toml`) is provided:

```toml
# config.toml
[search]
ignore_case = true
max_results = 100

[cache]
enabled = true
path = "cache/scrutator_cache"
```

## Benchmark

On the developer's benchmark tests, Scrutator has shown to be approximately 105,000 times faster than the native Windows search utility, making it an ideal tool for users requiring rapid and repeated file searches.
